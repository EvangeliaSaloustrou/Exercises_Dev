'''
Remember `list`,`set`,`dictionary` are mutable and `tuple` is immutable
`list`,`tuple` elements can be reached by index  
for `dictionary` it is not an option to reach by index the element key has to be known to reach  
and for `set` the items cannot be reached directly but it is possible to iterate.
'''
list1 = ["lion", "monkey", "dog","fish"]
tuple1 = ("lion", "monkey", "dog","fish")
set1 = {"lion", "monkey", "dog","fish"}
dict1 = {"lion":4, "monkey":2, "dog":4,"fish":2}


'''
1. print the lengths of `list1`,`tuple1`,`set1`,`dict1`
2. print the first element of `list1` and `tuple1`
3. print the value of `lion` key of `dict1`
4. change the 2nd position element of `list1` to "rabbit"
5. try to change the 2nd position element of the tuple to "rabbit" and explain what happened.
6. add "monkey" to `list1`
7. remove "rabbit" from `list1`
8. in `dict1` the number of feet is written as value to each animal the fixh has wrong value just fix it.

'''
'tuple' object does not support item assignment.
Tuples are immutable.
If we want to change a value in a tuple,
we can convert it into a list, change it, and convert it back into tuple.
