# Functions - Exercise 1 🐍

'''

to create functions in python we start with `def` word and after it the `name of function` comes with without parameters  
example is here 
```
def hello():
    print("hello")
```

Now you create a function named goodbye without parameters which prints good bye   

'''

def hello():
    print('good' + ' ' + 'bye')
hello()
